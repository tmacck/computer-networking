**Question**

Why are standards important for protocols?


**Answer**

Standards are important to protocols because they determine the procedure for which systems interact over a network. Protocols allow various devices and networks to easily interact through shared language and expectations. This allows the network to grow quickly and for new devices to interact with other devices.
